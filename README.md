## Installation

To use Adam as your virtual helping bot, follow these steps:

1. Install the required modules:
   - **Pyaudio**: Pyaudio provides audio input and output functionality.

   You can install these modules by running the following command:

   ```

   If you encounter any errors during installation, you can use the provided `setup.py` file to install the modules automatically.

   **Note:** If you face difficulties installing the PyAudio Python module, you can try installing it through the PyAudio executable file. Alternatively, you can visit [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and search for the suitable wheel file for your system. Once downloaded, you can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install <complete-name-of-your-wheel-file>
   ```

2. Once the required modules are installed, you're ready to start using Adam as your virtual helping bot!

## Getting Started

1. Import the Adam module into your Python script:

   ```python
   import adam
   ```

2. Create an instance of the Adam class:

   ```python
   bot = adam.Adam()
   ```

3. Interact with Adam by calling the available methods. For example, you can use the `ask_question()` method to ask Adam a question:

   ```python
   question = "What's the weather like today?"
