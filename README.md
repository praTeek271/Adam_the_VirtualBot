# Phenix
Virtual assistant python code program



If you want to use the phenix virtual Chatbot , there a few things I would you to install firstly,
    > Pyaudio
    > Speech Recognition
    > Pyttsx3

 If you face any error in installing these modules feel free to use the setup.py file to install these modules


 in case you feel error in insatalling PyAudio Python module try installing them through the PyAudio executsble file of just visit https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/   and search and download the suitable wheel file for your sysytem , 
 
 in my case I used " PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl  "   
 feel free to chose any suitable for your device , and install them using 

    >  pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
                            or
    >  pip install <Complete name of your wheel file>
